Only one of &#x60;product_ids_all&#x60;, &#x60;product_ids_any&#x60;, or &#x60;all_products&#x60; can be set.  Max: 500 catalog object IDs. | [optional]

Max: 500 catalog object IDs. | [optional] 
**quantity_exact** | getQuantityExact() | setQuantityExact($value) | **int** | If set, there must be exactly this many items from &#x60;products_any&#x60; or &#x60;products_all&#x60; in the cart for the discount to apply.

See &#x60;quantity_exact&#x60;. Defaults to 0 if &#x60;quantity_exact&#x60;, &#x60;quantity_min&#x60; and &#x60;quantity_max&#x60; are all unspecified. | [optional] 
**quantity_max** | getQuantityMax() | setQuantityMax($value) | **int** | If set, the pricing rule will apply to a maximum of this many items from &#x60;products_any&#x60; or &#x60;products_all&#x60;. | [optional] 
**all_products** | getAllProducts() | setAllProducts($value) | **bool** | If set to &#x60;true&#x60;, the product set will include every item in the catalog.  Only one of &#x60;product_ids_all&#x60;, &#x60;product_ids_any&#x60;, or &#x60;all_products&#x60; can be set. | [optional]
